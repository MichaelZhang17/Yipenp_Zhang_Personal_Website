    <h1>Thank You</h1>
    <p>
	This piece is dedicated to everyone I love.

      I don't know when it started, but I became reserved and reluctant to express myself. I don't know when it started, but I began to often combine acknowledgments with achievements. The reason I came to these conclusions stems from my observations of others. For example, an athlete giving a speech after winning a gold medal or championship, a school asking award recipients to deliver acceptance speeches during ceremonies, or a scholar including acknowledgments at the end of a completed thesis. So I wondered: Is it only after achieving success that one is entitled to thank others? As for my current thoughts, I believe that is not the case. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, gratitude doesn't require a specific occasion or specific achievements. In a study on the Ig Nobel Prizes, I came across an interesting conclusion: luck is a significant factor in whether someone succeeds or not. The author argued that even highly capable individuals can be defeated by random processes. Unfortunately, how many people in this world can truly achieve success? I used to be extremely self-critical, believing that I should be the best person. Because of this mindset, I suffered greatly. I realized that there are so many things I cannot do, and so many people who are more talented than me. This made me feel discouraged. After a long process of reconciling with myself, I finally reached this point. After gaining clarity about myself, I realized that even in our ordinary or even difficult days, there are still things worth being grateful for and cherishing at every moment. All the pain, the falls, the help and companionship from others are precious gifts in life. That’s why I wrote this article, because I know that even though I’m just an ordinary student who hasn’t achieved anything remarkable, I still have things to be grateful for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, I’m willing to write down what’s on my mind and offer this gratitude to everyone I love. Thank you all for your help. I went through a very difficult period, and it was only through your support that I managed to get through it. I am so happy to have met all of you. I also want to thank myself. Thank you for not giving up when faced with difficulties. My perseverance and efforts have shaped who I am today. I believe that the future me, when looking back at the present me, will feel the same way.

      仅以此篇，献给我爱的所有人
    </p>
    <p>
      从不知道什么时候开始，我变得内敛且不爱表达。不知道从什么时候开始，我开始常常将致谢与成果放到一起。我得出这些结论的原因来源于我对别人的观察，比如，一名运动员在夺得金牌或者夺得冠军之后上台发表感言，学校在颁奖的时候让领奖者发表获奖感言，又或者是一名学者在论文写完的最后写上论文的致谢。所以我想，是否只有人们在出人头地之后才有资格感谢别人吗？至于我现在的想法而言，我觉得并不是。
    </p>
    <p>
      其实，感谢从来都不需要特定的场合，更不需要特定的成果。之前在搞笑诺贝尔奖的研究中看到过一个很有趣的结论：运气是在每个人成功与否的显著因素。作者论证了即便是非常有能力的人也会拜倒在随机过程之中。丧气的说，这个世界上能成功的人到底能占多大一部分呢。我曾经极度内耗，认为我自己就应该是最优秀的那个人，因为这个想法我吃尽了苦头，我意识到这个世界上有太多我不能做到的事情，也有太多比我优秀的人。这让我感到沮丧。我经过了漫长的与自我和解的过程，才走到现在。在看清自己后才发现，在我们平凡的日子甚至糟糕的日子里也同样值得我们时时刻刻去感激与珍惜。所有的痛苦，跌倒，别人给予的帮助与陪伴都是生活中弥足珍贵的馈赠。于是就有了这篇文章，因为我知道即便我现在是个没有做出过任何突出成绩的莘莘学子，我也有值得感激的事情。 
    </p>
    <p>
      今天我愿意坦然地将心中所想写下来，将这份感激献给我爱的所有人。感谢你们所有人对我的帮助，我曾度过过很糟糕的时期，全靠你们帮助我度过，我很开心能认识你们所有人。我也要感谢我自己，感谢我自己在遇到困难的时候并没有放弃，我的坚持与努力造就了今天的我。我相信未来的我在看到现在的我的时候也会这么觉得。
