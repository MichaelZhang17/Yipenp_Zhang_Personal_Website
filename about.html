  <!-- 1. Personal Growth & Inspiration -->
  <section id="growth">
    <h1>My Journey</h1>

    <p>
      I was born and raised in Beijing, China. For my middle-school I attended  
      <strong>Beijing No.4 Middle School</strong>, where I first discovered my love for numbers and logic.

    <p>
      I continued my secondary education at the  
      <strong>Experimental High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University</strong>,  
      diving deeper into advanced math courses and participating in science fairs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Halfway through, I moved abroad to attend  
      <strong>Grand Rapids Christian High School</strong> in Michigan, USA.  
      Immersed in a new curriculum, I excelled in calculus and statistics while adapting to a different culture.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mathematics had always been my strongest subject—solving puzzles as a child or competing in math contests.  
      When I arrived at university, I realized that “math” branched into countless fields. A Data Science course opened my eyes to how statistical modeling, machine learning, and visualization can turn raw data into compelling stories and actionable insights. I immediately knew this was the path for me.
